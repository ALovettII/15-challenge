# 15-Challenge
 Combine AWS skills with Python to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.


You’ll be asked to accomplish the following main tasks:
1. Configure the initial robo advisor:
    * Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.
2. Build and test the robo advisor:
    * Make sure that your bot works and accurately responds during the conversation with the user.
3. Enhance the robo advisor with an Amazon Lambda function:
    * Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation.
    * This includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and integrating it with the bot.

For the submission, you will upload the following files to your repo:
* A Python script with your final Lambda function.
* Two short videos or animated GIFs that demo your robo advisor in action from the “Test bot” pane as requested
